/*

  Purpose:

    The purpose of parallelizing that code is to enhance its performance by concurrently summing the elements of a list using multiple execution threads. This approach becomes valuable when dealing with large datasets or when there is a need to reduce the execution time of intensive computational operations.

  Example:

  This OpenMP Modification makes parallelizing the code involves distributing the workload among several threads, allowing multiple operations to be performed simultaneously on different parts of the list. This concurrency can lead to a significant acceleration compared to the sequential execution of the same code.
